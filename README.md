# Running TypeScript in the browser

parcel-bundler npm pack helps us run typescript in the browser!

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

We will include "ts" files names as scripts (inside script tag) in the index.html. Normally only "js" files allowed but parcel bundler helps us converting them to "js" files and replace these ts files. When running the app:

```
parcel index.html
```
